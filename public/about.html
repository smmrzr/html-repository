<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I am a multilingual linguist and web enthusiast with over 17 years of
  professional experience in translation, interpretation (English ↔ French),
  language instruction, and administrative support. With a background in English
  and French from the Ghana Institute of Languages, I have worked across
  educational, nonprofit, and digital sectors, delivering language services in
  both onsite and remote settings. My work spans conference interpreting, legal
  translation (birth, death, and marriage certificates, police reports), and
  community engagement across culturally diverse contexts.

  In addition to my language expertise, I possess practical skills in web
  development, including website building, testing, and basic front-end
  customization. I have used these digital skills to support multilingual
  content creation and improve accessibility for language learners and clients.
  I have also taught French and German (A1-A2 levels) to over 40 students across
  multiple batches, while maintaining a personal learning journey in German,
  currently at B1 level. My approach to both language and technology is grounded
  in clarity, usability, and purpose-driven communication.

<p>
  Currently, I am preparing for graduate studies in Germany, with academic
  interests in African studies, language politics, migration, and digital
  communication. I am open to opportunities that combine my strengths in
  language services, education, and digital tools — especially roles that
  promote cross-cultural dialogue, inclusive technologies, and sustainable
  development through multilingual access. I believe in the power of language
  and tech together to bridge worlds and tell stories that matter.
